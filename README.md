# JavaScript Digital Clock

It's pretty simple to make a digital clock in JavaScript. Once you learn about 
the date object and setInterval, you're home free.

## Suggestions for making it your own:

```
* Style it as you wish, obvs.
* Change the font for the display; a monospace font would look more like a digital clock, and it wouldn't jar your eye as the variable-width string is recentered every second.
* Button for toggling between 12-hour and 24-hour display.
* Add the date (day, month, and year).
* An ANALOG clock!
```
